# Snap!

This repo is for a simple snap game I've created to teach myself more web technologies. Specifically, I wanted to learn more about:

* Servers and backends
* Client / server communication
* Rust
* Elm
* Websockets
* CSS animations

## Developing

To set up, install Rust/Cargo and Python3.11, then run `make install`. This
will install everything else.

To test the app locally, run `make run`.

## Feature wishlist

* Cooldown for drawing cards to avoid draw-spam
